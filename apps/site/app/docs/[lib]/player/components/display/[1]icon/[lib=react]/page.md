Media Icons is a collection of icons we've designed at Vidstack to help with building audio and
video player user interfaces. You can preview the entire collection in our
[media icons catalog](/media-icons?lib=react).

## Installation

Before you can begin using icons make sure to install the
[`media-icons`](https://github.com/vidstack/media-icons) package like so:

```bash
npm i media-icons
```

## Usage

All icons can be imported from the `@vidstack/react/icons` like so:

```js
// Refer to our catalog for all icon types.
import {
  ChromecastIcon,
  PauseIcon,
  PlayIcon,
  // ...
} from '@vidstack/react/icons';
```

Once imported, icons can be used like so:

{% code_preview name="usage" size="small" copy=true /%}
