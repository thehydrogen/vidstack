## Usage

All media elements exist inside the `$tag:media-player` component. It's main jobs are to manage
media state, dispatch media events, satisfy media requests, and expose media state through HTML
attributes and CSS properties for styling purposes.

DOM so you can obtain a reference to it when it's ready:
